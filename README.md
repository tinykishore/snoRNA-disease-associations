The intricate role of small nuclear RNAs (snoRNAs), a subset of small RNA molecules guiding chemical modifications in
other RNAs, spans diverse biological processes. Dysfunctions in snoRNAs significantly contribute to the genesis and
progression of complex diseases. However, conventional experimental methods are laborious and costly, impeding
snoRNA-disease association identification. To address this, we propose a pioneering GBDT-LR model, merging gradient
boosting decision trees (GBDT) with logistic regression (LR). Leveraging k-means clustering to screen negative samples,
GBDT-LR extracts distinctive features via GBDT and subsequently feeds them into an LR model for association score
prediction. This approach yields an impressive 93% accuracy and 88% ROC AUC, revolutionizing the identification of
associations between non-coding RNAs and diseases. This computational strategy, integrating available data and tools,
efficiently predicts unknown associations between diseases and snoRNAs. Leveraging machine learning techniques,
particularly the adept GBDT model in feature extraction, followed by LR for association prediction, demonstrates
significant potential in predicting complex disease associations with high accuracy.
